:::tip
It's recommended to add kazaplan widget in a full dedicated web page

You can however add an header with some basic user information (profile,
cart...) and a "back" button to redirect user to your homepage or
somewhere else
:::

## Widget Integration

Add the following `<script>` in the page where you want to integrate Kazaplan

```html
<!-- Preproduction -->
<script src="https://preprodintegration.kazaplan.com/js/integration.js"></script>

<!-- Production -->
<script src="https://integration.kazaplan.com/js/integration.js"></script>
```

After the integration script is added in your page, the Kazaplan
application needs to be configured using the following `<script>`
(parameters description below)

```javascript
var app = Kazaplan({
    htmlNode: "#integration-div",
    env: "prod",
    config: {
        partnerKey: "xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        plan: {
            id: [...],
            mode: "bathroom"
        },
    environment: "test",
},
onReady: function() { },
onKazaplanEvent: function(name, status, data) { },
```
